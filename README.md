This is a repository of computer graphics assignments. 

A4 has a project ray tracer, much of it is based on the book *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics* by
Peter Shirley et al. 

Implemented features include:

- Secondary ray reflections
- Phong shading
- Importing object files with triangle mesh and vertex coordinates (I make meshes in Blender and export an object file)
- Anti-aliasing
- Shadows

Here is a sample scene from it.
