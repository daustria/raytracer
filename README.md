This is a repository of computer graphics assignments. 

A4 has a project ray tracer, much of it is based on the book *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics* by
Peter Shirley et al. 

Implemented features include:

- Recursive ray reflections
- Phong shading
- Loading .obj files, particularly from Blender
- Textures
- Anti-aliasing
- Shadows

Here is a sample scene from it.
